## The program
To prevent the common scam that involves sub-contracting loads, we made a face authenticator to make sure that the person who checks in and out of the website is the same person who booked the load by scanning their faces before and after.

## Pre-requisites
`cd findface`
`npm install --save react-router-dom@5`
`npm install vite`
## Instructions
To run the program, do `npm run dev`
