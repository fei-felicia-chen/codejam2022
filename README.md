## Inspiration
From [123Loadboard Codejam 2022 challenges](https://codejam.123loadboard.com/), there are common scams that would involve sub-contracting loads; someone would book a load but would get a sub-contractor to haul the load for them. We wanted to build a platform which would prevent someone else to pretend to be the one who booked the load.

## What it does
In order to prevent someone to pretend to be the original contractor, the latter needs check in/check out with a face authenticator, which is what our platform provides. After logging in with user's face and PIN, the user can check in or out. The check in and check out would match the current location with the location of the truck.

## How we built it

## Pre-requisites
`cd project\findface`
`npm install --save react-router-dom@5`
`npm install vite`

## Instructions
To run the program, do `npm run dev`
